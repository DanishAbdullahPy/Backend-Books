üìö Book Tracker Backend
A robust, scalable REST backend for managing books, built with best-practice NestJS architecture, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL.

üõ† Tech Stack
NestJS (TypeScript)

Prisma ORM

PostgreSQL (Neon free tier recommended)

üß© Architecture & Approach
Feature-Based Modularity:
All book-related logic resides in a dedicated BooksModule, following the modular structure recommended by NestJS. This structure enables effortless scaling‚Äînew features or resources can be added by simply creating new modules.

Dependency Injection:
Controllers delegate to services using NestJS‚Äôs DI system, creating a clear separation between API logic and business/data logic.

Type Safety:
100% TypeScript is used throughout the codebase, providing static type checking, robust IDE support, and fewer runtime errors.

Prisma ORM:
Database access is handled with a singleton PrismaService, which wraps the Prisma Client for efficient DB connection management. The Book model is defined and managed via Prisma migrations.

RESTful API:
Exposes clear, conventional endpoints (GET /books, POST /books) returning JSON responses for frontend or any REST client.

Environment-Driven Config:
Environment variables store database connection strings and CORS origins, supporting secure deployments and easy local development.

CORS Security:
CORS is configured for both development and production via environment, ensuring the API is only accessible by specified frontends.

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone Repository & Install Dependencies
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Backend-Books.git
cd Backend-Books
npm install
2. Configure Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory:

text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
PORT=4000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.com,http://localhost:3000
3. Prisma Setup
bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push   # or npx prisma migrate deploy (if using migrations)
4. Start the API Server
bash
npm run start:dev
Default port: 4000 (configurable via PORT environment variable).

üìñ API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Request Body
GET	/books	Retrieve all books	-
POST	/books	Add a new book	{ "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author" }

üìù Development Notes
Easily extensible: Add new modules and providers as needed.

Safe for production: Never hardcodes sensitive configuration.

Integrated CORS: Works out of the box with your Next.js or any frontend.

Automated DB Sync: Use Prisma migrations to version control your database schema.

üí° Approach (Expanded)
This backend codebase closely mirrors professional NestJS backend projects:

All logic for a given domain (here, books) is grouped‚Äîmaking it easy for teams to collaborate and maintain clear code boundaries.

Rigid use of environment variables keeps sensitive data away from public code and supports clean multi-environment deployments (local, production, preview, etc).

Prisma‚Äôs type-safe queries and migrations provide reliable, maintainable database integration‚Äîfuture migrations are straightforward and robust.

Clear, RESTful routes and clean JSON payloads make the API easy to consume and test.

The main server bootstrap file is simple and clear‚ÄîCORS origins and port numbers are dynamic, never hardcoded, and easily tuned for any deployment.
